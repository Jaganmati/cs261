The contents of this repo contains a REST Web API, a game server for Linux, and a game client for Windows.<br>
The Web API runs on Node.js and works in conjunction with MongoDB for persistent data storage, Redis for temporary data storage, Express for REST, and Nginx for load balancing.<br>
This project builds off of the RoboCatAction project found <a href="https://github.com/MultiplayerBook/MultiplayerBook/tree/master/Chapter%208/RoboCatAction">here</a>, adding a web API, Linux support for the server, client-side user authentication, and SSL/TLS encryption.
